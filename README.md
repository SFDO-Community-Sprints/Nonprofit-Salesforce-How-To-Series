# NPSP-Videography

Welcome to the NPSP Videography repository! 

Here we will be tracking the work of the Power of Us Community Project, which creates short, digestible NPSP How-To videos from NPSP documentation. This project is community led with the help, support, and encouragement of our allies at Salesforce.org. Watch this space for ways you can help!

Volunteer and join the discussion on the [Power of Us Hub group](https://powerofus.force.com/s/feed/0D51E00005GfhR2SAJ)

[NPSP How-To Video Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8kDDLRZzDdOBS24al99Kag)

Starting in 2021, we will begin managing our open projects here in github. Head to the [Projects](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/NPSP-Videography/projects) tab to see what's in the works! Please excuse our dust-- volunteers to add to documentation & processes welcome!

Check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/NPSP-Videography/wiki) for instructions, sample scripts, and more!

## How You Can Help (At sprints or anytime!)

### Write, edit and review scripts
View the scripts in our current backlog [here](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/NPSP-Videography/projects/4). Note! You don't have to be an expert on the topic to contribute; you will be following documentation. But you probably *will* be an expert by the time you are done! 


### Translate exisiting NPSP Videography Scripts
* Spanish
* French
* German
* Japanese
* Dutch
* Hebrew

### Do a part of the Annual Video Review Project
Watch a 2-3 minute video and follow along in Salesforce, taking notes on any changes needed. View the tracking document [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ESTsr5OOnPXPfB2KTPOCDP0YfT3esYZWDdy_9yaAPbo/edit?ts=5f6b8d20#gid=1443784001)

### Record Narration on Videos
Here are some of the videos that will soon need narration. Anyone with a decent internet connection, a headset with a good mic, and a confortable speaking voice can volunteer. We usually record some scripts at every sprint.

### We are very active between sprints! 
Review the tasks you can help with above, and here are the projects in progress that need your help!
* Write and/or finalize the last of the scripts for the Gift Entry feature
* Have a piece of documentation you wish were more accessible: Make your passion project video happen!
* Review the existing videos for updates and changes (this is a great project for someone with less time)
* Put your voice in shining lights! Record narration for existing videos in progress (Headset required)
* Join our translation team!
